# Aldy, Gerarden and Sweeney (2019): Data and code for replication

This repo contains the data and code for replication for "Investment versus Output Subsidies: Implications of Alternative Incentives for Wind Energy"

**Abstract**

*This paper examines the choice between subsidizing investment or output to promote socially desirable production. We exploit a natural experiment to estimate the impact of these policy instruments on the productivity of wind farms. Using instrumental variables and matching estimators, we find that investment subsidy claimants produce 10 to 12 percent less power than they would have under the output subsidy. Introducing investment subsidies caused the Federal government to spend 14 percent more per unit of output from these power plants.*

A list of sources is provided [here](data_sources.pdf). Some of the data is proprietary, and we describe how these sources can be obtained. 

[Intermediate datasets](generated_data), cleaning and aggregating these data are provided (as Stata .dta files) such at that all of the tables and figures in the text can be reproduced using the ["analysis"](code/analysis) code. ["Build"](code/build) code, which produces the intermediate data is provided for those able to obtain the proprietary data sets.
